ER Model (Entity-Relationship Model)

An Entity-Relationship (ER) Model is a graphical representation of a database's structure. 
It's like a blueprint that shows how different pieces of information are related to each other. 
This model is used in database design to visualize the entities, their attributes, 
and the relationships between them before the actual database is created.

Purpose: To design and visualize a database logically.

Main Components:

Entity: Any real-world object, person, place, or concept about which data is stored. 
(e.g., Student, Course, Teacher). Represented by a rectangle.

Attribute: A property or characteristic of an entity. 
(e.g., StudentID, StudentName). Represented by an oval.

Relationship: An association between two or more entities. 
(e.g., A Student enrolls in a Course). Represented by a diamond.


Cardinality

Cardinality in an ER model defines the number of instances of one entity that can be associated 
with the number of instances of another entity in a relationship. 
In simple terms, it specifies "how many" entities are involved in a relationship. 
It's a fundamental constraint that helps define the business rules.

Representation: Cardinality is often expressed using notations like Crow's Foot notation 
on the lines connecting entities.


Relationship Types

Relationships are classified based on their cardinality. The three main types are:

1. One-to-One (1:1) Relationship
In this relationship, one record in a table is associated with one and only one record in another table.

Definition: An instance of Entity A can be related to at most one instance of Entity B, 
and an instance of Entity B can be related to at most one instance of Entity A.

Example: A Person can have only one Passport, and a Passport can belong to only one Person.

2. One-to-Many (1:N) Relationship
This is the most common relationship type. 
One record in a table can be associated with one or more records in another table.

Definition: An instance of Entity A can be related to many instances of Entity B, 
but an instance of Entity B can be related to only one instance of Entity A.

Example: One Customer can place many Orders, but each Order belongs to only one Customer.

3. Many-to-Many (M:N) Relationship
In this relationship, one or more records in a table can be associated with one or more records in another table.

Definition: An instance of Entity A can be related to many instances of Entity B, 
and an instance of Entity B can also be related to many instances of Entity A.

Example: Many Students can enroll in many Courses. 
A single student can take multiple courses, and a single course can have multiple students.
