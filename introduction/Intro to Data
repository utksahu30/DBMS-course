Intro to Data

Understanding Data and Knowledge


    
Definition of Data
        
            Data is an unprocessed set of inputs.
            It is a collection of facts about the object of interest.
            Example: Data about a student includes name, address, roll number, subjects, marks, etc.
        
        
Importance of Data
        
            Software applications need to store data to answer specific questions.
            Data helps in conveying stories, such as categorizing a student as a top performer.
        
        
From Data to Knowledge
        
            Data alone does not convey meaning; it is just a collection of facts.
            Understanding patterns in data and giving it significance turns it into information.
            Information helps answer questions like who, when, what, where, etc.
            The union of data and information leads to knowledge, which helps answer the how question and make business decisions.
