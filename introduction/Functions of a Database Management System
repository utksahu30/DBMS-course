The main functions of a Database Management System (DBMS):

1. Data Dictionary Management
The DBMS manages a data dictionary, which is a special file that contains metadataâ€”that is, data about your data. 
This includes information like data types, field names, constraints on the data, and relationships between tables. 
This dictionary is what the DBMS and users reference to understand the structure of the database.

2. Data Storage Management 
The DBMS handles all the physical aspects of storing data. 
It translates the logical data structures used by applications into the physical file formats on disk. 
This function also includes managing memory for caching and optimizing how data is retrieved from and written to storage devices.

3. Data Transformation and Presentation 
A key function of a DBMS is to transform the raw data into a format that is easily understood and used by applications and users. 
For example, it can format dates, convert data types, or mask sensitive information, 
ensuring the data is presented in a consistent and required manner.

4. Security Management 
The DBMS provides a robust security system to protect the database from unauthorized access. 
This includes creating user accounts, assigning different levels of permissions (e.g., read-only, read-write), 
and enforcing these access rules to ensure data privacy and protection.

5. Concurrency Control
In a multi-user environment, it's common for multiple users to try and access or modify the same data simultaneously. 
The concurrency control function of the DBMS ensures that these concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other, 
preventing data inconsistencies and maintaining the integrity of the database.

6. Backup and Recovery Management 
The DBMS is responsible for the safety and reliability of the data. 
It provides tools for creating backups of the database and for recovering the database to a consistent state in case of a system failure, 
such as a power outage or a software crash.

7. Data Integrity Management 
This function ensures that the data in the database is accurate and consistent. 
The DBMS enforces integrity constraints, which are rules that the data must follow. 
For example, a rule might prevent a user from entering a non-existent student ID into an enrollment table, 
thereby maintaining the relationships between tables.

8. Database Access Languages and APIs 
A DBMS provides a language and an Application Programming Interface (API) to interact with the database. 
The most common language is SQL (Structured Query Language), which allows users to perform tasks like 
creating database structures, querying data, and updating records.

9. Database Communication Interfaces 
A DBMS can provide interfaces that allow it to communicate with other systems over a network. 
This enables applications running on different machines to access and manipulate the database, 
which is fundamental to client-server and web-based applications.
